This is a fused source version of gtest 1.7.0. All that should be necessary to
start using gtest in your package is to declare the dependency and include
gtest/gtest.h.

However, because some of the packages that are developed in Sierra do not use a
fused source version of gtest we need to make it possible for them to build with
this version as well as with their native build. To facilitate this we have
created symlinks for the other gtest headers that they use to the fused source
gtest.h. This will make it possible for them find the headers while still using
the fuse source version. This should not have any ill effects since the header is
protected and allows for only using the non-gtest.h headers in their files.
