# has a doc/ subdirectory with its own Doxyfile that points to its own
# files.  The other Kokkos subpackages don't currently have their own
# Doxyfile files, so we have to do it manually here.

# mfh 26 Sep 2013: I've only added those directories in the Core
# subpackage that constitute the "public interface" of that
# subpackage.  Please feel free to include additional subdirectories

# mfh 26 Sep 2013: I've only added the Kokkos subpackages here that I
