# Kokkos: Core Libraries

Kokkos Core implements a programming model in C++ for writing performance portable
applications targeting all major HPC platforms. For that purpose it provides
abstractions for both parallel execution of code and data management.
Kokkos is designed to target complex node architectures with N-level memory
hierarchies and multiple types of execution resources. It currently can use
CUDA, HPX, OpenMP and Pthreads as backend programming models with several other
backends in development.

Kokkos Core is part of the Kokkos C++ Performance Portability Programming EcoSystem,
which also provides math kernels (https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-kernels), as well as
profiling and debugging tools (https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-tools).

# Learning about Kokkos

A programming guide can be found on the Wiki, the API reference is under development.

For questions find us on Slack: https://kokkosteam.slack.com or open a github issue.

For non-public questions send an email to
crtrott(at)sandia.gov

A separate repository with extensive tutorial material can be found under
https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-tutorials.

Furthermore, the 'example/tutorial' directory provides step by step tutorial
examples which explain many of the features of Kokkos. They work with
simple Makefiles. To build with g++ and OpenMP simply type 'make'
in the 'example/tutorial' directory. This will build all examples in the
subfolders. To change the build options refer to the Programming Guide
in the compilation section.

Other compilers are tested occasionally, in particular when pushing from develop to
master branch. These are tested less rigorously without `-Werror` and only for a select set of backends.

# Building and Installing Kokkos
Kokkos provide a CMake build system and a raw Makefile build system.
The CMake build system is strongly encouraged and will be the most rigorously supported in future releases.
Full details are given in the [build instructions](BUILD.md). Basic setups are shown here:

## CMake

The best way to install Kokkos is using the CMake build system. Assuming Kokkos lives in `$srcdir`:
````bash
cmake $srcdir \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=$path_to_compiler \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$path_to_install \
  -DKokkos_ENABLE_OPENMP=On \
  -DKokkos_ARCH_HSW=On \
  -DKokkos_ENABLE_HWLOC=On \
  -DKokkos_HWLOC_DIR=$path_to_hwloc
````
then simply type `make install`. The Kokkos CMake package will then be installed in `$path_to_install` to be used by downstream packages.

To validate the Kokkos build, configure with
````
 -DKokkos_ENABLE_TESTS=On
````
and run `make test` after completing the build.

For your CMake project using Kokkos, code such as the following:

````cmake
find_package(Kokkos)
...
target_link_libraries(myTarget Kokkos::kokkos)
````
should be added to your CMakeLists.txt. Your configure should additionally include
````
-DKokkos_DIR=$path_to_install/cmake/lib/Kokkos
````
or
````
-DKokkos_ROOT=$path_to_install
````
for the install location given above.

## Spack
An alternative to manually building with the CMake is to use the Spack package manager.
To get started, download the Spack [repo](https://github.com/spack/spack).
````
A basic installation would be done as:
````bash
> spack install kokkos
````
Spack allows options and and compilers to be tuned in the install command.
````bash
> spack install kokkos@3.0 %gcc@7.3.0 +openmp
````
This example illustrates the three most common parameters to Spack:
* Variants: specified with, e.g. `+openmp`, this activates (or deactivates with, e.g. `~openmp`) certain options.
* Version:  immediately following `kokkos` the `@version` can specify a particular Kokkos to build
* Compiler: a default compiler will be chosen if not specified, but an exact compiler version can be given with the `%`option.

For a complete list of Kokkos options, run:
````bash
> spack info kokkos
````
Spack currently installs packages to a location determined by a unique hash. This hash name is not really "human readable".
Generally, Spack usage should never really require you to reference the computer-generated unique install folder.
More details are given in the [build instructions](BUILD.md). If you must know, you can locate Spack Kokkos installations with:
````bash
> spack find -p kokkos ...
````
where `...` is the unique spec identifying the particular Kokkos configuration and version.
Some more details can found in the Kokkos spack [documentation](Spack.md) or the Spack [website](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

## Raw Makefile
A bash script is provided to generate raw makefiles.
To install Kokkos as a library create a build directory and run the following
````bash
> $KOKKOS_PATH/generate_makefile.bash --prefix=$path_to_install
````
Once the Makefile is generated, run:
````bash
> make kokkoslib
> make install
````
To additionally run the unit tests:
````bash
> make build-test
> make test
````
Run `generate_makefile.bash --help` for more detailed options such as
changing the device type for which to build.

## Inline Builds vs. Installed Package
For individual projects, it may be preferable to build Kokkos inline rather than link to an installed package.
The main reason is that you may otherwise need many different
configurations of Kokkos installed depending on the required compile time
features an application needs. For example there is only one default
execution space, which means you need different installations to have OpenMP
or Pthreads as the default space. Also for the CUDA backend there are certain
choices, such as allowing relocatable device code, which must be made at
installation time. Building Kokkos inline uses largely the same process
as compiling an application against an installed Kokkos library.

For CMake, this means copying over the Kokkos source code into your project and adding `add_subdirectory(kokkos)` to your CMakeLists.txt.

For raw Makefiles, see the example benchmarks/bytes_and_flops/Makefile which can be used with an installed library and or an inline build.

# Kokkos and CUDA UVM

Kokkos does support UVM as a specific memory space called CudaUVMSpace.
Allocations made with that space are accessible from host and device.
You can tell Kokkos to use that as the default space for Cuda allocations.
In either case UVM comes with a number of restrictions:
* You can't access allocations on the host while a kernel is potentially
running. This will lead to segfaults. To avoid that you either need to
call Kokkos::Cuda::fence() (or just Kokkos::fence()), after kernels, or
you can set the environment variable CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1.
* In multi socket multi GPU machines without NVLINK, UVM defaults
to using zero copy allocations for technical reasons related to using multiple
GPUs from the same process. If an executable doesn't do that (e.g. each
MPI rank of an application uses a single GPU [can be the same GPU for
multiple MPI ranks]) you can set CUDA_MANAGED_FORCE_DEVICE_ALLOC=1.
This will enforce proper UVM allocations, but can lead to errors if
more than a single GPU is used by a single process.
