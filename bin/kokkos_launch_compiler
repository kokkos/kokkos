#   This script allows CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER to be a standard
#   C++ compiler and Kokkos sets RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE and
#   RULE_LAUNCH_LINK in CMake so that all compiler and link
#   commands are prefixed with this script followed by the
#   C++ compiler. Thus if $1 == $2 then we know the command
#   was intended for the C++ compiler and we discard both
#   $1 and $2 and redirect the command to NVCC_WRAPPER.
#   If $1 != $2 then we know that the command was not intended
#   for the C++ compiler and we just discard $1 and launch
#   the original command. Examples of when $2 will not equal
#   $1 are 'ar', 'cmake', etc. during the linking phase
#
