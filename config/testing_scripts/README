jenkins_test_driver is designed to be run through Jenkins as a
multiconfiguration job. It relies on a number of environment variables that will
only be set when run in that context. It is possible to override these if you
know the Jenkins job setup. It is not recommended that a non-expert try to run
this script directly.
